# Notebooks-Folder

In the notebooks/ folder, create a few key notebooks to guide your analysis process. Suggested notebooks:

01_data_exploration.ipynb: Initial data exploration and visualization to understand the structure of the data, check for missing values, and look at distributions.
02_data_cleaning.ipynb: Data cleaning notebook where you handle missing values, perform basic preprocessing, and possibly save the cleaned data to data/processed/.
03_feature_engineering.ipynb: Feature engineering to create new variables that might be relevant for understanding depression (e.g., stress_level, social_interaction_frequency, sleep_quality).
04_modeling.ipynb: Model training and evaluation to identify which features are most predictive of depression.

## Documentation-and-Testing

Add Tests in tests/
Create simple unit tests for each of your functions. This helps ensure that your functions for loading data, feature engineering, and modeling work as expected.

Document Everything
Include comments in your code and write explanations in your notebooks. Use README.md to provide clear instructions on how to reproduce your results.

## Run-Notebooks-and-Analyze

With your setup complete, start working through each notebook in sequence:

Data Exploration: Explore distributions, correlations, and potential relationships.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data and basic preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that may be relevant for predicting depression.
Modeling: Train and evaluate your model, then interpret results to understand the most important factors associated with depression.
