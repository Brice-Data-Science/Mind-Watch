# Notebooks-Folder

    In the notebooks/ folder, create a few key notebooks to guide your analysis process. Suggested notebooks:

    01_data_exploration.ipynb: Initial data exploration and visualization to understand the structure of the data, check for missing values, and look at distributions.
    02_data_cleaning.ipynb: Data cleaning notebook where you handle missing values, perform basic preprocessing, and possibly save the cleaned data to data/processed/.
    03_feature_engineering.ipynb: Feature engineering to create new variables that might be relevant for understanding depression (e.g., stress_level, social_interaction_frequency, sleep_quality).
    04_modeling.ipynb: Model training and evaluation to identify which features are most predictive of depression.

## Documentation-and-Testing

    Add Tests in tests/
    Create simple unit tests for each of your functions. This helps ensure that your functions for loading data, feature engineering, and modeling work as expected.

    Document Everything
    Include comments in your code and write explanations in your notebooks. Use README.md to provide clear instructions on how to reproduce your results.

## Run-Notebooks-and-Analyze

    With your setup complete, start working through each notebook in sequence:

    Data Exploration: Explore distributions, correlations, and potential relationships.
    Data Cleaning: Handle missing data and basic preprocessing.
    Feature Engineering: Create new features that may be relevant for predicting depression.
    Modeling: Train and evaluate your model, then interpret results to understand the most important factors associated with depression.

## Aproach

    To predict depression using the provided mental health dataset, here are key steps and variables to focus on from a data science perspective. The goal is to identify factors that might correlate with depression, then use these features to build a predictive model. Letâ€™s break down the approach and key data elements.

## Target Variable

    Depression: This is the primary outcome you want to predict. If it's categorical (e.g., "Yes" or "No"), this can be treated as a binary classification problem. If depression is measured on a scale, it could become a regression problem.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Before choosing features, conduct an initial EDA to understand the distribution, identify missing values, and check for outliers. Analyze correlations between features and the target variable, especially focusing on:

    Categorical Variables: Look at the distribution of depression across categories (e.g., gender, city, profession).
    Numerical Variables: Visualize correlations using scatter plots or histograms, especially for variables like age, CGPA, sleep duration, and work/study hours.

## Key Features to Focus on

Based on the provided features, here are some likely candidates:

    Demographics:
        Age: Depression rates can vary significantly across age groups.
        Gender: Gender can influence mental health experiences due to biological, psychological, and social factors.
        City: Geographic factors, access to mental health resources, and social environment might play a role. City data may require encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding) for modeling.

    Academic and Professional Factors:
        Working Professional or Student: This could capture different types of pressures and stressors (e.g., academic vs. job-related stress).
        Academic Pressure and Work Pressure: Both could contribute to mental health issues. These should be carefully explored to understand their relationship with depression.
        CGPA: Academic performance may influence mental well-being, especially for students.
        Study Satisfaction and Job Satisfaction: Satisfaction levels might be linked to depression, with lower satisfaction potentially indicating mental health struggles.
        Work/Study Hours: Long work/study hours might be associated with burnout, which is a risk factor for depression.

    Lifestyle Factors:
        Sleep Duration: Sleep issues are strongly correlated with mental health. Insufficient sleep could be a significant predictor.
        Dietary Habits: Diet has been shown to influence mental health, though this may be a weaker predictor without detailed dietary information.
    
    Psychosocial and Financial Factors:
        Financial Stress: Financial insecurity is a known risk factor for mental health issues, including depression.
        Family History of Mental Illness: A family history of mental health issues could increase susceptibility to depression.
    
    Personal Mental Health History:
        Suicidal Thoughts: Prior suicidal thoughts or ideations are important indicators of mental health struggles, including depression.

## Feature Engineering Suggestions

    Binary Encoding: Convert categorical variables like "Working Professional or Student," "Gender," and "Family History of Mental Illness" into binary features.
    Binning: Age could be binned into categories (e.g., young adult, middle-aged, senior) to help capture non-linear relationships.
    Interaction Terms: Create interaction terms (e.g., Academic Pressure x CGPA or Sleep Duration x Work/Study Hours) to capture complex relationships that may impact depression.

## Modeling Approach

    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
    Feature Selection: Use methods like correlation matrices, chi-square tests (for categorical features), or feature importance analysis (e.g., using random forests) to identify the most relevant features for predicting depression.
    Model Selection: Start with models suitable for classification (if predicting depression as a binary outcome), such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

## Evaluation Metrics

    Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for a balanced assessment, especially if there is an imbalance in depression cases in your data.
